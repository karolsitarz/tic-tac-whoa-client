# tic-tac-wtf ❌⭕❓
A real-time **two-player game**. Tic-tac-toe, but approximately 8 times as challenging.

## How to play?
There are 16 blocks you can place on the board. Think of them like ❌ and ⭕, but each of them can be classified by:
* **shape** - square or round
* **color** - red or blue
* **size** - small or big
* **hole** - solid or with hole

The game alternates between two stages:
* pick one of the available blocks (you can only use every block once)
* place down the block you received from your opponent

The game ends when there are no more moves, or when either of the players spots four blocks with the same trait forming a straight line.
